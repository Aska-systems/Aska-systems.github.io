For those who wish to conduct surveys that yield deeper insights, we offer support and implementation services for survey projects.

A common concern we hear in questionnaire surveys is not knowing how to phrase questions properly. While we do offer courses that explain this in our online materials, the more one thinks about it, the more one realizes that designing a survey with the "proper questions" can be challenging.

Survey design can be improved with reviews by knowledgeable and experienced individuals (expert reviews). However, for more comprehensive surveys, conducting small-scale experiments (focus groups) beforehand helps refine the process. In these small-scale surveys, a more flexible approach is needed to gain insights for revising the survey design. Our company offers services ranging from expert reviews to conducting focus groups utilizing Aska.
