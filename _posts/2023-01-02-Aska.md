Aska is a SaaS application that allows for quantitative evaluation of open-ended survey responses.

Aska operates like a social networking platform for sharing opinions. When an administrator user initiates a topic, respondent users can view each other's opinions, 'like' these opinions, or post their own. Based on the 'likes' collected from respondents, Aska organizes and analyzes this data using machine learning and Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides analysis results in a structured format. This method, which employs <a href="#">a different approach than natural language processing, allows for quantitative evaluation of surveys, including open-ended responses.</a>

In addition to the feature-rich Aska, we also offer a simplified version, `Alaska`, which is available for a free trial.

#### Ideal for:
- Those who want to conduct surveys but can't narrow down typical responses, making it impossible to use standard multiple-choice formats.
- Those who wish to conduct surveys on subjects that are difficult to characterize with words, such as images and videos.
- Those who have previously conducted open-ended surveys but were unable to quantitatively evaluate the responses, leading to unused data.
- Those who want to conduct surveys in multiple languages simultaneously.


#### Other Features:
- Standard multiple-choice responses are possible.
- Integration with other survey systems is available.
- To ensure the quality of submissions, responses can be set to remain private until approved by an administrator, preventing them from being shared with other respondents.
- To avoid priming effects, it's possible to configure the system so respondents can view others' answers only after submitting their own.
- Images and videos can be embedded for reference. Choices can be set not just as text but also as images or videos, allowing for flexible surveys.
- Dynamic translation allows for conducting surveys in different languages simultaneously (currently available only in our custom-ordered surveys).
