We offer a service to beautifully visualize your survey data.

From the data you provide, we create various visualizations, including the "Bouquet Diagram."

## Bouquet Diagram
### Brief Description
This is a chart that shows pie charts at the end of branches based on attributes, like "the percentage of men in their 30s who celebrate Christmas" or "the percentage of women among people in their 40s who don't celebrate Christmas." It allows you to overview the characteristics of results under various conditions.

### Detailed Description
This is a diagram that represents multi-dimensional contingency tables with dendrograms and pie charts. Unlike normal dendrograms that inherently have a hierarchical structure, here, since the attributes themselves don't have a hierarchy, by default, we draw all combinations of branches. The different branches are not independent; combinations with the same conditions will have the same distribution (reflecting the symmetry of the hypergeometric distribution). Behind the scenes, we calculate p-values using exact tests or chi-squared tests, allowing us to "prune" the branches of the dendrogram (note that this involves issues with multiple testing, so care must be taken when assessing statistical significance). If you have specific filtering conditions you want to focus on, we can "prune" accordingly.


## Orders
If you want to beautifully and clearly visualize your survey results, please place an order. Depending on your specified colors and filtering conditions, we will deliver one SVG file (vector data) and one PNG file (image data) each.
(Note: The versions posted on Instagram have additional background decorations, but we deliver only the Bouquet Diagram itself.)
