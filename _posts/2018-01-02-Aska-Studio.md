We create AI-explanatory videos from PDF documents or online materials.

We produce videos using PDF documents, presentation slides, script manuscripts, and other materials, leveraging generative AI technology. 
<a href="#">It is possible to prepare explanatory videos in various languages at a reasonable price.</a>

The produced videos can undergo a quality check through a pre-release review using Aska. 
The plan includes making final adjustments based on the review results.

- The maximum length of the video is 15 minutes.
- When generating videos from documents, we use generative AIs like GPT. Please be aware of this and place your order accordingly.

### Orders
