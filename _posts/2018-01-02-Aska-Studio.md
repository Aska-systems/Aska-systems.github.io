We create AI-explanatory videos from your PDF documents or online materials.

We produce videos using PDF documents, presentation slides, script manuscripts, and other materials, leveraging generative AI technology. 
<a href="#">It is possible to prepare explanatory videos in various languages at a reasonable price.</a>

The produced videos can undergo a quality check through a pre-release review using <a href="https://aska.systems">Aska</a>. 
The plan includes making final adjustments based on the review results.
