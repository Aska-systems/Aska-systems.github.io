Are you analyzing your collected data as **raw data**? We offer data cleaning services.

In questionnaire surveys, 'noise responses' can occur for various reasons. These can sometimes be detected based on the response time or the relative and absolute consistency of the answers. Our data cleaning service includes the detection and removal of such noise responses.

Even large-scale data, if significantly affected by noise responses, may lead to analysis results that greatly deviate from the actual situation. If you have concerns or dissatisfaction with your analysis results, please feel free to consult with us.

### About the Term
'Data Cleaning' is a term we use uniquely (though it's not entirely original as others use similar expressions). 'Data Screening' might be more common, but in the survey industry, 'screening' often refers to the screening of respondents, which can lead to confusion. Therefore, we intentionally use a different term for our service.
