<p>Aska operates like a social networking platform for sharing opinions. When an administrator user initiates a topic, respondent users can view each other’s opinions, ‘like’ these opinions, or post their own. Based on the ‘likes’ collected from respondents, Aska organizes and analyzes this data using machine learning and Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides analysis results in a structured format. This method, which employs <a href="#">a different approach than natural language processing, allows for quantitative evaluation of surveys, including open-ended responses.</a></p>

<p>In addition to the feature-rich Aska, we also offer a simplified version, <code>Alaska</code>, which is available for a free trial.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/Aska_usage_en.png" alt="Aska_usage_en" /></p>

<h4 id="ideal-for">Ideal for:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Those who want to conduct surveys but can’t narrow down typical responses, making it impossible to use standard multiple-choice formats.</li>
  <li>Those who wish to conduct surveys on subjects that are difficult to characterize with words, such as images and videos.</li>
  <li>Those who have previously conducted open-ended surveys but were unable to quantitatively evaluate the responses, leading to unused data.</li>
  <li>Those who want to conduct surveys in multiple languages simultaneously.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="other-features">Other Features:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Standard multiple-choice responses are possible.</li>
  <li>Integration with other survey systems is available.</li>
  <li>To ensure the quality of submissions, responses can be set to remain private until approved by an administrator, preventing them from being shared with other respondents.</li>
  <li>To avoid priming effects, it’s possible to configure the system so respondents can view others’ answers only after submitting their own.</li>
  <li>Images and videos can be embedded for reference. Choices can be set not just as text but also as images or videos, allowing for flexible surveys.</li>
  <li>Dynamic translation allows for conducting surveys in different languages simultaneously (currently available only in our custom-ordered surveys).</li>

<p>A common concern we hear in questionnaire surveys is not knowing how to phrase questions properly. While we do offer courses that explain this in our online materials, the more one thinks about it, the more one realizes that designing a survey with the “proper questions” can be challenging.</p>

<p>Survey design can be improved with reviews by knowledgeable and experienced individuals (expert reviews). However, for more comprehensive surveys, conducting small-scale experiments (focus groups) beforehand helps refine the process. In these small-scale surveys, a more flexible approach is needed to gain insights for revising the survey design. Our company offers services ranging from expert reviews to conducting focus groups utilizing Aska.</p>

We offer data cleaning services.</p>

<p>In questionnaire surveys, ‘noise responses’ can occur for various reasons. These can sometimes be detected based on the response time or the relative and absolute consistency of the answers. Our data cleaning service includes the detection and removal of such noise responses.</p>

<p>Even large-scale data, if significantly affected by noise responses, may lead to analysis results that greatly deviate from the actual situation. If you have concerns or dissatisfaction with your analysis results, please feel free to consult with us.</p>

<h3 id="about-the-term">About the Term</h3>
<p>‘Data Cleaning’ is a term we use uniquely (though it’s not entirely original as others use similar expressions). ‘Data Screening’ might be more common, but in the survey industry, ‘screening’ often refers to the screening of respondents, which can lead to confusion. Therefore, we intentionally use a different term for our service.</p>]]></content><author><name>Sal</name></author><category term="Survey" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Are you analyzing your collected data as raw data?

<p>From the data you provide, we create various visualizations, including the “Bouquet Diagram.”</p>

<h2 id="bouquet-diagram">Bouquet Diagram</h2>
<h3 id="brief-description">Brief Description</h3>
<p>This is a chart that shows pie charts at the end of branches based on attributes, like “the percentage of men in their 30s who celebrate Christmas” or “the percentage of women among people in their 40s who don’t celebrate Christmas.” It allows you to overview the characteristics of results under various conditions.</p>

<h3 id="detailed-description">Detailed Description</h3>
<p>This is a diagram that represents multi-dimensional contingency tables with dendrograms and pie charts. Unlike normal dendrograms that inherently have a hierarchical structure, here, since the attributes themselves don’t have a hierarchy, by default, we draw all combinations of branches. The different branches are not independent; combinations with the same conditions will have the same distribution (reflecting the symmetry of the hypergeometric distribution). Behind the scenes, we calculate p-values using exact tests or chi-squared tests, allowing us to “prune” the branches of the dendrogram (note that this involves issues with multiple testing, so care must be taken when assessing statistical significance). If you have specific filtering conditions you want to focus on, we can “prune” accordingly.</p>

<h2 id="orders">Orders</h2>
<p>If you want to beautifully and clearly visualize your survey results, please place an order. Depending on your specified colors and filtering conditions, we will deliver one SVG file (vector data) and one PNG file (image data) each.
(Note: The versions posted on Instagram have additional background decorations, but we deliver only the Bouquet Diagram itself.)</p>
